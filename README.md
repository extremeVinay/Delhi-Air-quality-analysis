Air quality index (AQI) analysis is a crucial aspect of environmental data science that involves monitoring and analyzing air quality in a specific location. It aims to provide a numerical value representative of overall air quality, essential for public health and environmental management.

Below are the steps I follow for the task of Air Quality Index Analysis:

1. Gather air quality data from various sources, such as government monitoring stations, sensors, or satellite imagery.
2. Clean and preprocess the collected data.
3. Calculate the Air Quality Index using standardized formulas and guidelines provided by environmental agencies.
4. Create visualizations, such as line charts or heatmaps, to represent the AQI over time or across geographical regions.
5. Compare the AQI metrics of the location with the recommended air quality metrics.
